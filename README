Initializing the project.
Idea discussed here: https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/86
A better portfolio - For Developers/Programmers. (Current, a prototype for web application for my own portfolio. Will extend it to a framework once basic setup is done!)

The aim of the project:
  - Build a portfolio tailored for a developer (a personal project at first)
  - Eventually, the idea is to have a framework setup for creating/customizing portfolios specifically tailored for
developers/programmers.

Currently, I am working on this project as a Portfolio for myself. I am using all the libraries and AppEngine mentioned below, so that I can setup the basic framework. To make it a customizable portfolio builting framework will be better once I have this!


Plugins/Libraries used:
- Metro-UI-CSS (https://github.com/olton/Metro-UI-CSS)
- SmoothDivScroll (https://github.com/tkahn/Smooth-Div-Scroll)
- KnockoutJS (https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout)
- jQuery.ScrollTo (https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo)

Running on Google AppEngine - Python
