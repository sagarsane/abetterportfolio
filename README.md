Initializing the project
========================


Idea discussed here: https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/86
A better portfolio - For Developers/Programmers. (Current, a prototype for web application for my own portfolio. Will extend it to a framework once basic setup is done!)

The aim of the project
-----------------------
- Build a portfolio tailored for a developer (a personal project at first)
- Eventually, the idea is to have a framework setup for creating/customizing portfolios specifically tailored for
developers/programmers.

*Currently, I am working on this project as a Portfolio for myself. I am using all the libraries and AppEngine mentioned below, so that I can setup the basic framework. To make it a customizable portfolio builting framework will be better once I have this!*


Plugins/Libraries used:
- Metro-UI-CSS (https://github.com/olton/Metro-UI-CSS)
- SmoothDivScroll (https://github.com/tkahn/Smooth-Div-Scroll)

Steps to setup your own portfolio using the Metro-UI Theme
----------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** Current setup allows anyone to setup their portfolio data (documented below) as a *Github GIST JSON File*
and then use this file on the python backend to consume them in this portfolio.
